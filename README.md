Test bed for creating a controller application for Android

Dreams: 
- Single Device
  - Create a trackpad (and/or add extra features to touch) so that games like "Defend Your Castle" can be played more easily
  - Create an overlay game pad so that other non phone browser games can be played
- Dual Device
  - Create an HTML keyboard which the app hosts so that it can be used as another phone's keyboard to save screen space and make typing easier
  - ...maybe... create a web app to facilitate screen and touch sharing so that two phones can watch youtube videos or something (for a setup that mimics the Axon M's Tent mode)
- Multi Device
  - Create HTML controlers so that other phones and computers can act as game controllers for games in emulators or games like Super Tux Kart (good if a game has TV out)
